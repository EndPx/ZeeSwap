# ZeeSwap
**Swap across chains. Keep your ZEC shielded.**

ZeeSwap is building bidirectional swaps, constrained intents and a backed-token bridge between shielded Zcash and Base. The first swap pair is ZEC / USDC; the prototype targets TAZ on Zcash testnet and a project-owned mockUSDC on Base Sepolia. The mock token is not deployed yet.

The Zcash CLI feasibility experiment, database foundation and local HTTP/scanner incoming-payment flow are verified. The testnet cross-chain product is still under construction.

- [Implementation plan](plan.md): scope, decisions and acceptance gates.
- [Zcash wallet tooling](workers/zcash-wallet/README.md) and [live G1 evidence](docs/evidence/g1-feasibility.md).
- [Database module](api/README.md) and [live Neon evidence](docs/evidence/g2-database.md): encrypted quotes, guarded order/deposit transitions, reservations, balanced journals and fenced jobs.
- [HTTP API and observer](docs/api.md) and [real incoming-payment evidence](docs/evidence/g2-api-scanner.md): one shielded deposit advances one private order to READY without a destination payout.
- [Submission readiness](docs/submission-readiness.md): evidence available to reviewers and the remaining demo requirements.
- [Explorer verification](docs/evidence/explorer-verification.md): confirmed transaction and explanation of the stale explorer link.

## Verify locally

With Node 24 and pnpm 10.21.0, these checks require no wallet or database credentials:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
python -m unittest discover -s workers/zcash-wallet -p 'test_*.py'
```

`pnpm test:integration` requires private operator configuration and uses the isolated regression branch. These deployment scripts deliberately allowlist the project's Neon endpoints; a fresh clone cannot access them without credentials. See [database setup and test isolation](api/README.md). `pnpm api:start` also requires private runtime and wallet configuration; primary funding routes remain gated.

## Privacy and trust

The operator can decrypt payments addressed to its shielded receiver and holds settlement inventory. This prototype uses a custodial operator model. Base transfers are public, and the operator can associate both sides of an order. The shielded claim applies to the Zcash leg; it does not promise end-to-end anonymity, atomic settlement or trustless custody.

There is no deployed frontend, Base contract or automated cross-chain payout service yet. The standalone Zcash payment experiment and incoming API order are evidence for those specific components, not a completed swap or bridge.
